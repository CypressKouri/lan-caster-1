NAME
    engine.geometry - Geometry Utility Functions.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides several using geometry functions that can be used
    with Tiled objects and object lists.
    
    Note, all angles below are in radians, starting a 3 oclock and increasing clockwise.
    You can convert between degrees and radians in your code as follows:
    
        import math
        r = math.radians(d)
        d = math.degrees(r)

FUNCTIONS
    angle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        Returns angle from (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in radians.
    
    angleLable(a)
        Returns the label ('Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right') of angle a
    
    distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        Returns distance between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
    
    normalizeAngle(a)
        Returns angle a in the normalized range of 0 - 2pi. Angle a must be in radians.
    
    objectContains(object, x, y, width=0, height=0)
        Returns True if rect defined by x, y, width, height overlaps object's rect else returns False.
        
        Note, a rect with width=0 and height==0 is a point.
    
    project(x, y, rad, dis)
        Returns point (x',y') where angle from (x,y) to (x',y')
        is rad and distance from (x,y) to (x',y') is dis.
    
    sortRightDown(listOfGameObs, maxWidth, useAnchor=True)
        Sort list of game objects by y and then x.
        
        Do sort in place but list is also returned in case it is needed.
        
        Schwartzian Transform is used to speed up sort.
