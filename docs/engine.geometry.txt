NAME
    engine.geometry - Geometry Utility Functions.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides several using geometry functions that can be used
    with Tiled objects and object lists.
    
    Note, all angles below are in radians, starting a 3 oclock and increasing clockwise.
    You can convert between degrees and radians in your code as follows:
    
        import math
        r = math.radians(d)
        d = math.degrees(r)

FUNCTIONS
    angle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        Returns angle from (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in radians.
    
    angleLable(a)
        Returns the label ('Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right') of angle a
    
    distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        Returns distance between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
    
    normalizeAngle(a)
        Returns angle a in the normalized range of 0 - 2pi. Angle a must be in radians.
    
    objectContains(object, x, y)
        Returns True if x,y is inside object's x, y, width, and height else returns False.
    
    objectsContains(objectList, x, y)
        Returns True if x,y is inside any object's x,y,width,height in objectList
    
    project(x, y, rad, dis)
        Returns point (x',y') where angle from (x,y) to (x',y')
        is rad and distance from (x,y) to (x',y') is dis.
    
    sortRightDown(listOfGameObs, maxWidth, useAnchor=True)
        Sort list of game objects by y and then x. Do sort in place but list is also returned in 
        case it is needed.
        
        Schwartzian Transform is used to speed up sort.
